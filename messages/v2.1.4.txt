Sublemacs Pro v2.1.4 Update
=============================

Improvements to incremental search behavior:

  * when searching backword, the cursor is at the beginning of the match
  * when the current search is failing, no longer highlights what used to match
  * wrap-around search is a little more intuitive

Other misc fixes include:

  * zap to char was not copying everything into the kill ring
