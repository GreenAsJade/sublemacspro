Sublemacs Pro v2.1.3 Update
=============================

Updated two commands with optional arguments:

  * sbp_swap_point_and_mark takes an optional toggle_active_mark_mode boolean, which defaults to
    false. This makes it possible to toggle showing the region without relying on the built-in C-U
    C-X C-X command.

  * sbp_move_to command takes an optional always_push_mark boolean, which can be used to have the
    bow and eow destinations also push the mark. Currently they do not by default.
