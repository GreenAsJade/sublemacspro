Sublemacs Pro v2.1.0 Updates:
=============================

This is a pretty substantial update with two main changes and two small features.

  * The first change is a huge jump in performance with multi-cursor movement commands. If you have
    100 cursors or more and run the forward word command you will see that the performance is
    comparable to the built-in sublime performance now. Same with forward s-expression, etc.

  * The other major change is multi-cursor support for the kill and mark rings. When you have multiple
    cursors and you delete words, s-expressions or lines, the corresponding kill ring entry will keep
    track of the individual cursors. This means you can now copy, kill and yank with multiple cursors
    and the right thing happens. This basically means you can now do things which you used to require
    keyboard macros for (which I have never been able to get working reliably in Sublime).

Just a note: if the number of cursors doesn't match the number of entries in the kill ring, the
regions in the kill ring are duplicated until there are enough. Also, if you're doing multiple kills
and the number of regions chagnes because cursors have been joined with other cursors, a new entry
in the kill ring is created. These scenarios can be confusing but they are not the norm.

It is also possible to set multiple marks and exchange a single point with multiple marks. I think
if you experiment with this you will see it works well.

In terms of features, there are two:

  * It is now possible to supply a numeric argument to the undo command.
  * The Meta-M command (move back to indentation) now works properly for lines that are wrapped.

Cheers!
