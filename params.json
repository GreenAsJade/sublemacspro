{"name":"Sublemacspro","body":"### Welcome to SublemacsPro.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind writing these set of functions is that I love Emacs, however, the UI doesn't feel as snappy as other Mac apps. On the other hand I cannot move to another editor since many of those hyped editors is that they don't provide the keybindings I love.\r\n\r\nThen, I found Sublime Text 2. A completly customizable editor allowing you to easily modify all default behaviors so that they suit your editing sytle.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote sublemacspro bringing Emacs keybindings and sugar to Sublime Text 2. Even though Emacs lives from the plugins, I beleive it is way easier to write new plugins in Python and integrate them in an Emacs-ish way to Sublime Text 2 than writing them in Lisp.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nTo install SublemacsPro you have to install [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) as an automatic package manager for Sublime Text 2. Now you can easily install Sublemacs Pro and your installation will never be outdated. When you installed Package Control, hit ``S-Shift P`` to open up the command palette and type ``install``. Now select \"Package Control: Install Package\". This will load all packages from the remore repository and you can select ``sublemacspro`` from the drop-down list.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nThe following features are supported and merged [from][ot3] [other][ot] [approaches][ot2]\r\nand the base code of the new beta of [Sublime Text 2][subl].\r\n\r\n   * Kill line, region ... with kill ring. All the sugar you love with a nice UI with ``M-w``, ``C-w``, ``C-y``\r\n   * Yank with free choice from kill ring using fancy overlay: Just press ``C-Y`` to access the kill ring and search for your last copy and pastie\r\n   * Rectangular cut and insert using ``C-x r t`` and ``C-x r d``\r\n   * Named registers to store data using ``C-x r s [register]`` and ``C-x r i [register]``\r\n   * Open a new line by ``C+o``\r\n   * Find file at point ``M-x f f a p`` opens the file your current cursor points to\r\n   * Automatic mode detection like it's done in Emacs using prefixes ``-*- c++ -*-``\r\n   * And many more ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Key Map\r\n\r\nThe key bindings are strictly oriented on their original Emacs counterpart,\r\nhowever, sometimes the action might be a little different due to other\r\nsemantics.\r\n\r\n### Future\r\n\r\nWe will try to extend this more and more to provide more features from Emacs to\r\nSublime Text 2 and make this my fast and beautiful Emacs replacement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n2012 Martin Grund (@grundprinzip), Brian M.
