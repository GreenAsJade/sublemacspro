Sublemacs Pro v2.1.6 Update
=============================

New feature: choose_and_yank. It allows you to display a popup window with a sample from each entry
in the kill ring, and then choose which one you want to yank.

One possible binding is this:

    {"keys": ["alt+super+y"], "command": "sbp_choose_and_yank"},
